## jQuery integration

http://cloudinary.com/documentation/jquery_integration

Cloudinary offers comprehensive APIs and administration capabilities and is easy to integrate with new existing web and mobile applications.

## jQuery Plugin Features

Cloudinary provides a [jQuery plugin](cloudinary_jquery_plugin.md) (open source) for further simplifying the integration:

* Build URLs for transformation & manipulation
* JavaScript helper methods for embedding and transforming images
* Direct uploading from the browser

### Note: The JavaScript library has undergone an extensive redesign.

Up until now, the library was deeply coupled with jQuery and the Blueimp jQuery File Upload plugin. In order to cater for developers who do not wish to use jQuery, the library is now available in three different flavors:

* **Core JavaScript Library**: The core Cloudinary JavaScript library which does not depend on jQuery
* **jQuery Plugin**: If you are using jQuery, you can take advantages of the Cloudinary jQuery plugin which includes all the functionality of the Core JavaScript Library.
* **jQuery File Upload**: The Cloudinary jQuery File Upload library extends the Cloudinary jQuery plugin that utilizes the Blueimp jQuery File Upload library. This library includes all the functionlity of the Core JavaScript Library and the jQuery plugin.
