# The Yarn Workflow

https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/yarn-workflow

Introducing a package manager into your project introduces a new workflow around dependencies. Yarn tries its best to stay out of your way and make each step of this workflow simple to understand.

There are a few things you should know about the basic workflow:

1. Creating a new project
2. Adding/updating/removing dependencies
3. Installing/reinstalling your dependencies
4. Working with version control (i.e. git)
5. Continuous Integration
