# Yarn

https://yarnpkg.com/en/

fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.

## Ultra Fast

Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download it again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.

## Mega Secure

Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.

## Super Reliable

Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked on one system will work exactly the same way on any other system.
