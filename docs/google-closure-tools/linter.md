# Closure Linter

https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/

Closure Linter is deprecated. 

For teams using the Closure tools, we recommend they use the new linter based on the Closure Compiler instead. You can do this by passing `--jscomp_warnings=lintChecks` to the compiler, or building the standalone linter binary; see the [Closure Compiler wiki](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Lint-checks) for details. The rest of the information on this page will be kept up for a while, for teams who are still using Closure Linter.
