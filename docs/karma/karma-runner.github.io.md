# Karma - Spectacular Test Runner

http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html

On the AngularJS team, we rely on testing and we always seek better tools to make our life easier. That's why we created Karma - a test runner that fits all our needs.

Things should be simple. We believe in testing and so we want to make it as simple as possible.

The main goal for Karma is to **bring a productive testing environment to developers**. The environment being one where they don't have to set up loads of configurations, but rather a place where developers can just write the code and get instant feedback from their tests. Because getting quick feedback is what makes you productive and creative.

## Test on Real Devices

Test your code on real browsers and real devices such as phones, tablets or on a headless PhantomJS instance.

## Remote Control

Control the whole workflow from the command line or your IDE - just save a file and Karma will run all the tests.

## Testing Framework Agnostic

Describe your tests with Jasmine, Mocha, QUnit, or write a simple adapter for any framework you like.

## Open Source

Developed for and maintained by the open source community at GitHub.

## Easy Debugging

Easy debugging directly from your IDE via WebStorm or Google Chrome.

## Continuous Integration

Simple integration with Jenkins, Travis or Semaphore.
